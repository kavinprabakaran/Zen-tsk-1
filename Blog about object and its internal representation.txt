Objects 

In JavaScript, is it’s most important data-type and forms the building blocks for modern JavaScript

These objects are quite different from JavaScript’s primitive data-types(Number, String, Boolean, null, undefined and symbol) in the sense that while these primitive data-types all store a single value each

Objects are more complex and each object may contain any combination of these primitive data-types as well as reference data-types.
An object, is a reference data type. Variables that are assigned a reference value are given a reference or a pointer to that value.

That reference or pointer points to the location in memory where the object is stored. The variables don’t actually store the value.

Objects and properties

A JavaScript object has properties associated with it.
A property of an object can be explained as a variable that is attached to the object
Object properties are basically the same as ordinary JavaScript variables, 
except for the attachment to objects. The properties of an object define the characteristics of the object. You access the properties of an object with a simple dot-notation

                    property name are case sensitive

Create JavaScript Object with Object Literal

to create a javascript object is object literal, simply define the property and values inside curly braces as shown below


               let bike = {name: 'SuperSport', maker:'Ducati', engine:'937cc'};
